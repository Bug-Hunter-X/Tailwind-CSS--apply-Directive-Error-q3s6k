# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS related to the `@apply` directive.  Using an incorrect class name with `@apply` results in no styling applied, making it difficult to debug.

## Bug Description
The issue occurs when you use the `@apply` directive with a class name that does not exist in your Tailwind CSS configuration or contains a typo. In such cases, Tailwind won't throw an error, but simply won't apply any styles. This silent failure makes the problem hard to identify, especially in larger projects.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Check the `bug.js` file and observe the unexpected behavior.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully checking the class names used within the `@apply` directive against your Tailwind CSS configuration. Using a linter that checks for valid Tailwind classes can prevent this type of error.

See `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.
